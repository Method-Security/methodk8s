# methodk8s Documentation

Hello and welcome to the methodk8s documentation. While we always want to provide the most comprehensive documentation possible, we thought you may find the below sections a helpful place to get started.

- The [Getting Started](./getting-started/basic-usage.md) section provides onboarding material
- The [Development](./development/setup.md) header is the best place to get started on developing on top of and with methodk8s
- See the [Docs](./docs/index.md) section for a comprehensive rundown of methodk8s capabilities

# About methodk8s

methodk8s provides security operators with a number of data-rich K8s enumeration capabilities to help them gain visibility into their K8s environments. Designed with data-modeling and data-integration needs in mind, methodk8s can be used on its own as an interactive CLI, orchestrated as part of a broader data pipeline, or leveraged from within the Method Platform.

The number of security-relevant K8s resources that methodk8s can enumerate are constantly growing. For the most up to date listing, please see the documentation [here](./docs/index.md)

To learn more about methodk8s, please see the [Documentation site](https://method-security.github.io/methodk8s/) for the most detailed information.
